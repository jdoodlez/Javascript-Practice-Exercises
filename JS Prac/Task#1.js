// Practice Set 1 â€” Variables & Data Types

// Main Exercise: Declare a variable called name and assign your name to it. Declare a variable age and assign your age. Print both using "console.log".

//Extra Practice:

/*  

1. Declare a constant PI with the value 3.14 and log it.
2. Try reassigning the PI value and see what happens.
3. Declare three different types of variables: a number, a string, and a boolean. Log their types using typeof. */


let name = "JD";
let age = "20";

console.log("My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.");

const PI = 3.14;

console.log(PI);

let num = 24;
let string = "Hilo gudmorning";
let boolean = true;

console.log(typeof num); 
console.log(typeof string); 
console.log(typeof boolean);
